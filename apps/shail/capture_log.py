"""
SHAIL Capture Log — in-memory event stream of backend activity.

A small ring buffer of the last N events keyed by user_id, exposed via
/browser/capture-log so the dashboard's Capture Log panel can show what
SHAIL is doing in near-real-time. State is intentionally non-persistent;
restart drops history. This is a live monitor, not an audit trail.

Event types:
    CAPTURE  — a new memory was ingested
    INDEX    — embedding stored to Chroma
    LINK     — a memory was linked to an ascent / deliverable / todo
    RECALL   — a memory was used as context for an LLM call
    PRUNE    — a memory was deleted (manual delete or auto-eviction)

Auth: every event carries a user_id. The endpoint filters by the
caller's user_id so users only see their own events.
